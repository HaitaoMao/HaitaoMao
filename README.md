### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

ðŸŽ“ I'm a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University (MSU) supervised by Dr. [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html). <font color="red">I am actively seeking industry position starting around May 2025.</font> 

My research interests include Graph Machine Learning, Recommender System, Large Language Model, and Information Retrieval. If you know of any relevant openings, I would greatly appreciate your consideration! More Details can be found in:

**My academic research** focuses on (i) developing **versatile graph models** rooted in network science, to achieve strong generalization and broad downstream graph applicability. (ii) **LLM mechanism analysis** to enhance output reliability.

**During my industry internship**, I learn about the **recommender system** in [Snap](https://research.snap.com/team/user-modeling-and-personalization.html), the **search engine** in [Baidu](https://searchscience.baidu.com/), and **tabular data intelligence** in [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/). During these internships, I (i) **transformed industry problems** into research challenges and organized WSDM CUP 2022 and KDD CUP 2023 accordingly (ii) **developed resource-efficient solutions** by identifying and leveraging relationships among data. My intern projects won CIKM 2021 Best Short Paper and WSDM 2024 Best Paper Honorable Mention.
