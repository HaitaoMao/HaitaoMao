ðŸŽ“ I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University supervised by Dr. [Jiliang Tang](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/index.html). <font color="red">I am actively seeking industry position starting around May 2025.</font> My research interests include Large Language Model, Recommender System, Information Retrieval, and Graph Machine Learning. If you know of any relevant openings, I would greatly appreciate your consideration! More Details can be found in [[my research blog]](https://haitaomao.github.io/categories/ResearchSummary/)


**My academic research** focuses on 
- Network Analysis [[paper1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00793)[[paper2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01323.pdf) and Graph Pre-training [[paper1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01899)[[paper2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02216.pdf)[[Research Statement]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DycBQkBdTCmZOWh9WHNo6gNrALHmDLfe/view?usp=sharing)[[Talk Slides]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RSfGXJAC11c3wc9Gduqg-SoMJ8qfbh7N/view?usp=sharing)
- Enhance LLM with Better In-context Learning Ability [[paper1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15286)[[paper2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02378)[[paper3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02212)


**Industrial Resource-efficient Solutions During Internships**
- LLM-based Generative Recommendation (ongoing), [**Snap Research, User Modeling and Personalization Team**](https://research.snap.com/team/user-modeling-and-personalization.html)
- LLM-based Ranking Algorithms [[paper1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10718.pdf)[[paper2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03051), [**Baidu, Search Strategy Team**](https://searchscience.baidu.com/)
- Accelerate and Stabilize Neural Network Training [[paper1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15414.pdf)[[paper2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06530.pdf), [**Microsoft Research Asia, Data Knowledge Intelligence Group**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/data-knowledge-intelligence/)

**Transform Industrial Problems into Academic Challenges**
- Organize [Baidu WSDM CUP'23](https://aistudio.baidu.com/competition/detail/536/0/introduction): Pre-training for Web Search. 
- Organize [Amazon KDD CUP'23](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/amazon-kdd-cup-23-multilingual-recommendation-challenge): Multilingual Shopping Session Recommendation. 

Moreover, I was engaged in **academic-industry collaborations** between MSU and several companies, including [Graph Mining team in Google Research](https://research.google/teams/graph-mining/),  [Query Understanding team in Amazon](https://amazonsearchqu.github.io/), [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), [J.P. Morgan AI Research](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence). I **led the [graph research subgroup](https://dse-gfm.github.io/)** in my PhD lab, where I made my best memory collaborating closely with my talented labmates sharing the same goal. I am now serving as the **organizer of the [Learning on Graph Conference 2024](https://logconference.org/)**, an exciting new conference facilitating graph and geometry community engagement.
